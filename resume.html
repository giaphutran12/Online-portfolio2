<h2>Projects</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/giaphutran/VR_Bus_2">VR Bus Simulator </a> (Three.js, Cannon.js)- Mar 2024</p>
<ul>
    <li>Developed a sophisticated Virtual Reality Bus Simulator that delivers a high-fidelity
         simulation of urban bus driving, leveraging WebXR and advanced Three.js graphics to provide an 
        immersive VR experience compatible with Meta Quest 2. Source code</li>
    <li>Engineered a comprehensive physics system using Cannon.js to simulate realistic 
        vehicle dynamics, including custom collision detection, vehicle kinematics, 
        and environmental interactions, enhancing the authenticity of the driving experience.</li>
    <li>Implemented intuitive control schemes that allow seamless vehicle steering 
        with the left joystick and a 360-degree environmental observation, 
        thus emulating the true-to-life operation of a bus.</li>
    <li>Integrated complex 3D models into the simulation using GLTFLoader, 
        which included an accurately scaled city map and a detailed bus model,
         achieving a seamless and engaging virtual representation of an urban landscape.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/giaphutran12/Whiteboard">WhiteBoard - ITS - Douglas College</a> (MySQL, PHP JavaScript, HTML, CSS) - July 2024</p>
<ul>
    <li>Developed and modified a dynamic website which included executing AJAX calls from end-user interaction,
         then fetching and populating data from MySQL database to show which employees are in charge of 
         which shift in which position today.</li>
    <li>Added and synchronized “phone number” and “comment” sections in the “Shift Table” 
        (where shifts are updated every day), which showed a productivity improvement of 20% in 
        scheduling and 5% overall.</li>
    <li>Modified HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components of the project to adjust front-end elements 
        such as arrows or drop-down menus to behave accordingly, increasing website readability by 25%.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="RPG Game">RPG Game: Lost in Desert</a> (UE5: C++, Blueprint) - April 2025</p>
<ul>
    <li>All core gameplay mechanics are implemented in C++ in a scalable way, using inheritance,
         interface, self-explanatory code by extensive refactoring, following best coding practices
          and design principles such as Observer</li>
    <li>Used Animation Template Blueprint to quickly create new types of enemies, 
        reducing the enemy creating time by 89%, average 15 minutes per new type of enemy.
         Enemies can patrol, attack, get hit, and die</li>
    <li>Used Motion Warping for the translation and rotation of the enemy while attacking
         to ensure a higher chance of hitting the main character, making the game harder to beat</li>
    <li>Used a 3D character from Fab (WindWalker Echo) as the main
         character for the game, animations include equipping sword,
          putting sword away, attack, dodge, jump</li>
    <li>Added a sound system to the game, when you hit something, get hit by something, 
        break something,
        or in general, stop idling, there is a MetaSound designed for that</li>
    <li>Built an open-world RPG level from scratch using Landscape and Foliage mode in UE 5</li>

    <li>Created HUD displaying character’s current health, stamina, gold and XP, screen messages, damage tint, etc.</li>
</ul>
